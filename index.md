I am a computer science major at CSUF and expected to graduate in 2028.


##Favorite CPSC 120L
*Lab 1

  This was my favorite lab because it was the first lab I did. I also learn the basics of git clone and using github. This lab was also the shortest.

*Lab 2

  Lab 2 is my second favorite lab because it's related to mad libs. One important thing I learn is line wrapping. This is useful because in future labs, there could be code that is longer, which needs line wrapping.

*Lab 4
  I like this lab because it was more complicated. My partner and I communicated outside of the classroom to get the work done. This one is math related because it involved changing measurements types like from teaspoon to tablespoon.
